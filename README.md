# 🧠 Assignment 01: Kickstart Your First Vue 3 Project

Welcome to your first Vue assignment! 🎉
In this task, you will scaffold a new Vue 3 project using the latest recommended tooling, clean it up, and begin familiarizing yourself with Vue's syntax and project structure.

---

## ✅ Objective

* Scaffold a Vue 3 app using the **latest Vite-based tooling** (from the official Vue documentation).
* Remove the default scaffolded files.
* Structure the project folders cleanly (components, pages, store, etc.).
* Explore Vue 3 syntax and file organization.

---

## 📌 Instructions

1. **Create a new Vue 3 app using Vite**

   > Follow the official quick-start guide:
   > [https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html)

   ```bash
   npm create vue@latest
   ```

2. **While creating the app**, choose these options:

   * Use **JavaScript** 

3. **Remove all default components**:

   * Delete `HelloWorld.vue`, `TheWelcome.vue`, and any associated imports/usages from `App.vue`.

4. **Create your own folder structure**:

   ```
   src/
   ├── assets/
   ├── components/
   ├── pages/
   ```

5. **Add sample placeholders**:

   * In `components/`, create a simple component like `Navbar.vue`.
   * In `pages/`, create a `Home.vue` and optionally `About.vue`.

6. **Explore Vue syntax**:

   * Use the `<script setup>` syntax.
   * Use `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, and `watch` (just for practice).
   * Understand `props`, `emits`, and basic component communication.

## 📁 Deliverables

* A GitHub repo with your project.
* The project should:

  * Not contain any default Vue starter components.
  * Have a clean and meaningful folder structure.
  * Include at least one or two custom components.


## 📅 Deadline

Please submit your GitHub repo link by: **\[23-07-2025]**
